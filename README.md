## TODO  
	
### Done  
1. Checkout request logic - remove request and make a user able to checkout directly via either clicking a request button or scanning a QR code. 
1. Checked out items: show "Checked out by <email address>" even on user side
1. Add "Item details" to user view. 
1. Search on enter  
1. Searching "2y0" results in error, searching in general. 
1. New feature: "Separate" QR code scanner that takes you to the correct item for both check in and check out. (e.g. you do not have to have selected the correct tiem to checkout or check in, instead it takes the QR code and maybe prompts a confirmation with the name. )  
1. Camera window in phone mode is larger than the window.
	
### To Do  

1. Users edit possibilities on items should only be on comment. User should be able to add comment (but not change other fields)
1. If checked out, it should show in the details of the item as well. (Instead of LastModified presumeably), or keep LastModifiedby and add CheckedOut by when relevant. 
1. Functionality of the QR code checkin and checkout reader. 
	1. Scanning a QR code results in nothing. 
	1. Have a confirmation of the QR code being scanned and checked in/checked out.
